When the day is dawning, on a Texas Sunday morning
How I long to be there
With Marie who's waiting for me there
Every lonely city (La-la-la-la-la), where I hang my hat (La-la-la-la-la)
Ain't as half as pretty as where my baby's at

Is this the way to Amarillo?
Every night I've been hugging my pillow
Dreaming dreams of Amarillo
And sweet Marie who waits for me
Show me the way to Amarillo
I've been weeping like a willow
Crying over Amarillo
And sweet Marie who waits for me
